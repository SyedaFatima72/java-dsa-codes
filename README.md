# Java DSA Codes

Java DSA Codes is a complete and organized collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations in Java, developed as part of my learning journey during the Bachelor’s in Computer Science program at COMSATS University, Attock (Fall 2022 – Spring 2026).
The purpose of this repository is to:

* Consolidate my understanding of core computer science concepts
* Practice clean and efficient coding techniques
* Create a reference for future projects and problem-solving
* Showcase my work to potential employers and collaborators

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into topic-wise folders, each containing Java programs related to that topic:

* Array

  * Creation, traversal, insertion, deletion
  * Searching (linear and binary)
    
* Linked\_List
  * Singly Linked List operations
    
* doubly
  * Doubly Linked List operations
    
* stack
  * Array-based and Linked List–based implementations
    
* Queue
  * Simple Queue, Circular Queue, Priority Queue
    
* Trees
  * Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree
  * Traversals: Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
    
* Graph
  
* Heap
  * Min Heap, Max Heap
    
* Sorting
  * Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort
  * Merge Sort, Quick Sort
    
* Searching
  * Linear Search, Binary Search
    
* Tasks
  * Miscellaneous problem-solving programs
